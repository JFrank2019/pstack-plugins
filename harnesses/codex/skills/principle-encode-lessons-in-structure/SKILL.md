> **pstack skill.** Most pstack skills are opt-in. Codex leaves them out of the skill list that the model sees, and users start one by typing `$pstack:<name>`. When this text names another pstack skill, read its `SKILL.md` in full at `../<name>/SKILL.md`, relative to the directory of this file. Tool names in pstack are Codex's. [`codex-tools.md`](../poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md) says what to do when one is missing.

# Encode Lessons in Structure

If the lesson needs judgment and cannot be encoded, make the instruction more prominent and add an example of the failure mode.

**Corollary:** If the fix is structural, only use the structural fix. The instruction is the symptom.
